MassivelyParallel
=================

Project for the course __Advanced Programming Massively Parallel Processors__ held by Professor Jens Hahn in Winter Term 2014/2015 at the [Stuttgart Media University](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de).


Build Instructions
==================

While building from the original source is possible, it requires you to have a couple of dependencies set up on your system. Thus, it is recommended to use the MassivelyParallel_Build archive provided as a [GitHub release][GH Releases].


Requirements
------------

* Visual Studio Toolset v120 or higher (Visual Studio 2013)
* OpenCL v1.1
* SFML 2.1, in case you're not building from the minimal source build package provided as a [release package][GH Releases].
* Python 3.x for some scripts used at compile time.

_Note: The code is only tested for nVidia graphics cards_


Running the projects
--------------------

Make sure the Working directory is set to the directory of the solution, i.e. $(SolutionDir).
